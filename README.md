# FEBQI Lab Homepage

Homepage of the **FEBQI (Floating Electrons and Beyond for Quantum Information) Lab**, led by Erika Kawakami at the RIKEN Center for Quantum Computing.

- **Live site (production):** https://febqi.github.io/lab-hp/
- **Live site (development):** separate staging site (URL not listed here)

## Development workflow

1. Edit files in this repository
2. Push to verify: `git push`
3. When ready to publish to `febqi/lab-hp`: trigger the **Mirror to febqi/lab-hp** workflow from the Actions tab

### Mirror workflow setup

The workflow (`.github/workflows/mirror-to-febqi.yml`) pushes `main` from the development repository to `febqi/lab-hp` on demand (manual trigger only).

**Required secret in the development repository:**

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `FEBQI_TOKEN` | Classic Personal Access Token with `repo` + `workflow` scopes, belonging to an account with write access to `febqi/lab-hp` |

To regenerate: GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token (classic) → check `repo` and `workflow` → save as `FEBQI_TOKEN` in the development repository's secrets.
